This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) blog project with `json-server` as fake backend.

> This is still a work in progress

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Then, open a new terminal and run the mock backend server:

```bash
npm run serve
# or
yarn serve
```

This runs the `json-server` configured in the project for api calls and DB interactions.
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) with your browser to see the result.
